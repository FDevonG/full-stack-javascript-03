Developed with regex and javascript, this form validation project is the third project in the full stack javascript tech degree on teamtreehouse.com

Using the inout event listener applied to the form element I have created a realtime validation system to the inputs applied on line 26.
Using the formError() method on line 173, I am applying different messages to the elements depending on if they are empty or formated incorectly.
